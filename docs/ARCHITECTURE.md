## 1. What the app is (one paragraph)

A local, single-user web app run with `npm run dev` on one Mac, in a browser. It takes a
customer's approved artwork and "fills" it into a pre-made print layout (a **pre-nest**: a
sheet with empty slots, normally 12 caps' worth), rotating and clipping each piece into
its slot, stamping metadata, applying a global fabric-stretch scale, and exporting a
print-ready PDF that RasterLink (the RIP) opens and prints. Two human roles: **Mila**
aligns/approves artwork; **Santosh** runs the print and approves output. No cloud, no
accounts, local files only.

```

The **only** scaling in the whole pipeline is the global fabric-stretch factor at the very
end. Everything else is 1:1.

**Second flow — DXF Tile Export ("DXF only" jobs, no printing).** The Run Screen tab now
opens with one question — *"Does this job include printed artwork?"* (`RunEntry.jsx`).
**With artwork** mounts the unchanged `RunScreen.jsx` pipeline above; **DXF only** mounts
`TileExportScreen.jsx`: a pre-packed PDF tile (pieces already arranged and spaced) →
`tileInspect.js` (tile = the page box; size in mm + Check A: warn if geometry sits within
5 mm of a tile edge — two abutting insets give the 10 mm inter-tile gap) → operator enters
fabric width (mm) + quantity → `tileMath.js` (usable = fabric − 20 mm per side, length
axis borderless; Check B **hard error** if the tile is wider than usable; quantity =
tiles, **any whole number ≥ 1** — no pre-nest sheet, so no per-sheet rounding) →
`tileExport.js` duplicates the tile's contours by **translation only** onto the row-major
grid and writes ONE byte-deterministic DXF through the existing `buildDxf`; the screen's
canvas preview draws that exact layout (contours × placements + margin guides). No
auto-nesting, no collision detection, nothing stripped or recolored. Switching branches
via the "Change" control unmounts the branch — a clean reset; the branches share no state.

**Per-piece ID label (step 6b, distinct from the corner stamp).** Separately from the
single `STYLE | FABRIC | QTY` corner stamp, `engine.js` prints each panel's `piece_type`
name *inside that panel* so the cut/sew team can tell pieces apart. Implementation lives in
`fillLayout` (the "Piece-ID labels (U5)" block) with helpers `bottomBands()` /
`interiorSpansAtY()`. It is computed once per piece-type in the piece's own (template)
coordinates: a bottom-edge interior-span scan picks the lowest band that fits the text
inside the *true outline* (so concave crescent visors keep it inside the shape, never in
the bounding-box void), the label is left-justified ~2 mm inside that run's real left edge,
and the text is **drawn rotated with the slot** so it rides on the same physical spot of
every panel regardless of orientation (orientation is irrelevant — pieces are moved around
after cutting). Font is small shrink-to-fit (~4.5–8 pt). The label is **reference-only**:
it sits inside the cut line in the seam band, is hidden once sewn, and never overlaps a
neighbour or the clip region (invariants §5.4/§5.6 preserved). It does not affect placement,
rotation, clipping, or the export path. Gated by the `pieceLabels` flag (default on).

## 3. Canonical file layout (where things live)

Only the parts that matter for working on the app are listed. `node/`, `node_modules/`,
and `dist/` are generated/vendored — out of scope, do not edit.

## 4. Module responsibilities & dependencies

Use this to see the blast radius before editing.

| Module | Owns | Depends on | Depended on by |
|--------|------|------------|----------------|
| `src/lib/engine.js` | The fill pipeline (place, rotate, clip, stamp, scale, multi-sheet) | `pdf-lib`, `pdfGeometry`, `pdfPaths` | `RunScreen.jsx` |
| `src/lib/verifyArtwork.js` | Pre-export checks: region presence/size (blocking) + color-profile advisory (confirmation naming the exact profile, or warning; never blocks) & flatten advisory | `pdf-lib`, `pdfRender`/`scanRegions` (lazy, DOM-only) | `RunScreen.jsx`, `engine.js` |
| `src/lib/pdfGeometry.js` | Box/transform/rotation math | — (leaf) | engine, verify, editors |
| `src/lib/pdfPaths.js` | Vector path extraction from PDFs | `pdfjs-dist` | engine, detectRegions |
| `src/lib/pdfRender.js` | Rasterize PDF pages for display | `pdfjs-dist` | `PdfViewer.jsx` |
| `src/lib/detectRegions.js` | Auto-detect closed-path slots | `pdfPaths`, `scanRegions` | `MappingTool.jsx` |
| `src/lib/scanRegions.js` | Region scan support | `pdfPaths` | `detectRegions` |
| `src/lib/dxf.js` | DXF / laser geometry | `pdfGeometry` | engine / laser path |
| `src/lib/tileInspect.js` | DXF Tile Export stage 1: tile (page) size in mm + Check A (5 mm edge-inset, warn-only) on the pre-packed PDF tile | `pdf-lib`, `pdfPaths` | `TileExportScreen.jsx` |
| `src/lib/tileMath.js` | DXF Tile Export stage 2: pure grid math — 20 mm side margins, cols/rows, row-major placements; Check B hard error; any whole quantity ≥ 1 | — (leaf) | `TileExportScreen.jsx` |
| `src/lib/tileExport.js` | DXF Tile Export stage 3: tile contours (mm, tile-relative) duplicated by translation onto the placements → one byte-deterministic DXF | `dxf.js`, `engine.js` (`flattenSubpath` only) | `TileExportScreen.jsx` |
| `src/RunEntry.jsx` | Run-tab fork: mounts RunScreen or TileExportScreen; "Change" unmounts (clean reset, no shared state) | `RunScreen.jsx`, `TileExportScreen.jsx` | `App.jsx` |
| `src/TileExportScreen.jsx` | DXF-only screen: upload tile → Check A → width/qty → Check B → canvas layout preview → export DXF (RunScreen's visual language/classes) | `tileInspect`, `tileMath`, `tileExport` | `RunEntry.jsx` |
| `src/lib/api.js` | Talk to `server/` middleware | fetch | screens |
| `src/lib/pdriveSync.js` | P-drive style sync: computer-id, machine-level sync-root memory, content hash, append-only events, replay, seed, reconcile, publish (Node-only) | `node:fs/os/path/crypto` | `server/styles-api.js`, `scripts/pdrive-*.js` |
| `server/styles-api.js` | Persist styles/fabrics, optional gs flatten; on save/delete, publish the style to the P-drive sync root | `pdf-lib`, Ghostscript (shell), `pdriveSync` | `api.js` |

**Rule of thumb:** `pdfGeometry.js` is a leaf — safe-ish to optimize internally but
widely depended on, so its behavior must not change. `engine.js` is the highest-risk file
(it owns the proven RasterLink output); touch it with the most care and always test export.

**P-drive style sync (data, not program).** Styles are shared between office machines
through an **append-only event log** on the P drive, not by copying snapshots. The sync
root (the folder `data/backup.json`'s `path` points at) holds three subfolders: `events/`
(one tiny JSON file per add/update/delete — never overwritten, so machines can't clobber
each other), `current/` (the live style folders, the only sync source), and `backups/`
(dated + per-version + per-deletion recovery copies; **never** read as a sync source). The
"what should exist" set is *computed* by replaying events (sort by `at`, fold
add/update/delete). Saving or deleting a style (`server/styles-api.js`) publishes it to
`current/` and appends the event **last** (crash-safe); the retrieve launchers
(`scripts/pdrive-retrieve.js`) replay + reconcile the local machine to that set —
add/update/skip-unchanged/delete-with-recoverable-warning. The sync-root path is
remembered in **two places**: the app copy's git-ignored `data/backup.json` (primary)
and a **machine-level copy** at `~/.purnaa-tools/sync-root.json` (same dir as the
computer-id — survives re-clones, second app copies, and app updates; both written by
`pdriveSync.js`'s `read/writeSyncRootFile`). Retrieve resolves it in order: the
**running app** (`GET localhost:4173/api/backup`) → this copy's `data/backup.json` →
the machine-level file; whatever it resolves it writes back to both (self-heal), so a
retrieve run with the app closed, or from a fresh clone, still finds the folder the
operator set once in the browser. The server likewise adopts the machine-level value
when its own `backup.json` is empty. All one Node implementation
(`pdriveSync.js`) so Mac and Windows behave identically. Content identity is a `sha256`
over the sorted `relPath+bytes` of a style folder, so unchanged styles are skipped. This
is LAN file sync on the existing P-drive channel — **no cloud, no service** (invariant §10
intact). Local saves always succeed; if the P drive is unreachable the publish is skipped
and the UI warns the change isn't shared yet.

---

## 5. Invariants (correctness — do not break without spec-level sign-off)

These are the reason the output is correct. Full rationale in
`SPEC.md` / `CLAUDE_CODE_LASER_VS_DIECUT.md`.

1. **No scale-to-fit, ever.** Artwork and template piece must be identical physical size.
   Mismatch → refuse + flag. Only the global fabric-stretch factor scales, at export.
2. **Match by `piece_type` label**, never by absolute coordinates across files. Template
   and pre-nest are different artboards / coordinate spaces.
3. **Rotation is per-slot**, read from the saved map. Two pieces of the same type may be
   rotated differently. Never infer rotation from piece type.
4. **Clip to the true piece outline** (not a bounding rectangle) so neighbors don't bleed
   in; grow by the tunable bleed margin so each piece keeps its own print bleed.
5. **Embed artwork once, share across all placements.** This is the fix for the old ~6×
   file-size bug. Any fill/embed change must preserve it.
6. **Cut line printed for laser only; other guides reference-only.** The laser follows a
   black cut line printed around each piece, so laser exports keep it. Die-cut runs do
   **not** print it (the die cuts the shape; a printed line is just unwanted ink) — gated
   by `cutMode === 'die'` in `engine.js`. Stitch lines/text/fills are stripped from output.
7. **Inputs keep vectors intact; only the final export may be flattened.**
8. **Quantity rounds UP to whole sheets (×12).** 50 caps → 60 → 5 identical sheets.
9. **Direct-vector export is the proven path.** Ghostscript flatten is a rare fallback,
   intentionally frozen (its 120s timeout and ~163s gs runtime on big soft-mask art are
   known and accepted). Don't touch it unless asked.
10. **Local only.** No cloud, auth, accounts, or deployment.

---

## 6. Known cleanup targets (track, don't act without sign-off)

These are bloat/hygiene issues to resolve carefully during the optimization phase. Each
should be its own small, confirmed change. **Do not bulk-delete.**

- **`node/` is a committed Node.js runtime** (full openssl/v8 header trees, npm, etc.).
  This almost certainly should be git-ignored, not in the repo. Confirm with owner before
  removing from version control. Same question for `node_modules/` and `dist/`.
- **Duplicate update plans:** `CLAUDE_CODE_UPDATE_PLAN.md` exists at repo root *and* in
  `docs/archive/`. Root copy should move to `docs/` or `docs/archive/`. The root is for
  config and the `COMMAND CENTER/` launcher folder only.
- **Possible duplicate prenest source:** `AI files of PRENEST and TEMPLATES/60203-DADHAT/`
  contains both `DADHAT(OSFM)_PRENEST.ai` and `pur60203-DADHAT(OSFM)_PRENEST.ai`. Confirm
  which is canonical; remove the stale one.
- **Inconsistent style-folder naming:** `styles/MIDPRO5PANEL-PUR5610101/` looks like a
  typo of `PUR560101` (used everywhere else). Renaming a style folder is a structural
  change — confirm it isn't referenced by a stored map before touching.
- **`style.json` filename drift inside styles:** e.g. `template_v1.pdf` /
  `prenest_laser.pdf` in the 5-panel folder vs. plain `template.pdf` / `prenest.pdf`
  elsewhere. Confirm the engine's expected names and standardize.
- ~~**Launchers other than START still hardcode `~/purnaa-cap-nesting`.**~~
  Resolved: `install`, `update`, and "Retrieve New Styles from P Drive"
  (`.command`/`.bat`; the `.ps1` inherits via the `.bat` `pushd`) now use the
  same location-aware-with-fallback derivation as START — they act on the app
  folder the launcher lives in, falling back to `$HOME/purnaa-cap-nesting` only
  when launched from outside an app folder. Fixes the master-Mac stray-clone
  divergence and the "No backup folder is set yet" mismatch on Retrieve.
- ~~**No CHANGELOG.**~~ Resolved: `docs/CHANGELOG.md` exists (one line per change).
- **Sparse tests.** Only `engine.test.js`, `pdfPaths.test.js`, `schema.test.js` exist.
  As you optimize a module, add a focused regression test for the behavior you're
  protecting — especially fill math, rotation anchors, clip geometry, and size-mismatch
  refusal.

## 7. How to use this file when making a change

1. Find the module you're changing in §3/§4. Note its dependents (blast radius).
2. Check §5 — does the change risk any invariant? If yes, stop and ask.
3. Make the minimal edit, test against `test-files/` and `tests/`.
4. If you moved/added/removed a module or changed the flow or an invariant, update §2–§5
   here and bump the "Last updated" date.
5. If you resolved or discovered a hygiene issue, update §6.
